译者注：几个月之前翻译了[Good UI](http://www.goodui.org/)前 20 个最佳实践[【翻译】优秀的用户界面设计](./blog/2013-06-28-Good-UI.md)。最近又看到有了更多的最佳实践。现在翻译出来，与您分享。

1. 渐变而不是立即变化

Try Transitions instead of showing changes instantly. Interface elements often appear, hide, move, shift, and resize as users do their thing. As elements respond to our interactions, it sometimes is a little easier to comprehend what just happened when we sprinkle in the element of time. A built in intentional delay in the form of an animation or transition, respects cognition and gives people the required time to understand a change in size or position. Keep in mind of course that as we start increasing the duration of such transitions beyond 0.5 seconds, there will be situations where people might start feeling the pain. For those who just wish to get things done quickly, too long of a delay of course can be a burden.
